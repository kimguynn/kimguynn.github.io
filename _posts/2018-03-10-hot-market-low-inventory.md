Have you been sitting on the fence, waiting for the right time to sell your home in Lynn Haven, Panama City or Panama City Beach, Florida?

Spring is a popular time to put your home on the market. Buying has seasons to it and as winter ends we see a big influx of Buyers hitting the market.

This year that is starting a little early. In February of this year our absorption rate was at 4.38 months. We like to see that stay between 5-7 months for a balanced market. If it falls below, like it is now, then we are low on inventory. This may mean that Sellers have an advantage in the market especially for 'in demand' price ranges.

However, as spring ramps up we will see more and more homes hit the market as statistically April-July are the most popular to list. You still need a strong marketing plan that strategically places your home in front of the most amount of Buyers.

If you are looking for the most competitive Seller's package to sell your house for the most amount of money in the shortest amount of time then I have the answer for you! Get ahead of the listing rush and allow me to prepare a no obligation market analysis of your home.

Low inventory may present a special opportunity for you. Now is the time to call. I look forward to showing that advantage to you.
